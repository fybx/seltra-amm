Seltra AMM - Product Requirements Document
Executive Summary
Seltra AMM is a next-generation Dynamic Liquidity Automated Market Maker built on Algorand blockchain. The protocol automatically adjusts liquidity allocation based on real-time market conditions, volatility patterns, and trading volume to maximize capital efficiency and fee generation for liquidity providers while minimizing slippage for traders.
Key Value Propositions

Adaptive Liquidity Management: Automatically redistributes liquidity based on market volatility
Enhanced Capital Efficiency: 3-5x better capital utilization compared to traditional constant product AMMs
Dynamic Fee Optimization: Variable fee structures responding to market conditions
MEV Protection: Built-in mechanisms to protect against Maximum Extractable Value attacks
Cross-Asset Intelligence: Multi-pool coordination for optimal liquidity distribution


Project Overview
Problem Statement
Traditional AMMs suffer from static liquidity distribution leading to:

Poor capital efficiency during low volatility periods
Excessive slippage during high volatility
Suboptimal fee generation for LPs
Inability to adapt to changing market microstructure

Solution Architecture
Seltra AMM implements algorithmic liquidity management through:

Volatility-responsive concentration: Tighter spreads during calm markets, wider during volatile periods
Volume-weighted rebalancing: Higher liquidity allocation to active price ranges
Cross-pool arbitrage capture: Internal arbitrage mechanisms to capture value
Predictive rebalancing: Machine learning models for liquidity pre-positioning

Target Market

Primary: DeFi traders seeking optimal execution
Secondary: Institutional liquidity providers requiring sophisticated yield strategies
Tertiary: Protocol integrators building on top of efficient AMM infrastructure


Technical Architecture
Core Components
1. Dynamic Liquidity Engine (DLE)

Volatility Oracle: Real-time volatility calculation using EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average)
Liquidity Allocator: Algorithmic distribution engine
Rebalancing Trigger: Event-driven rebalancing based on market conditions

2. Smart Contract Architecture (Algorand Python)
python# Core Contract Structure
class SeltraAMM:
    # State Variables
    liquidity_pools: Dict[AssetPair, Pool]
    volatility_oracle: VolatilityOracle
    fee_engine: DynamicFeeEngine
    rebalancing_module: RebalancingModule
    
    # Core Functions
    def add_liquidity(self, assets: Tuple[Asset, Asset], amounts: Tuple[int, int])
    def remove_liquidity(self, lp_tokens: int)
    def swap(self, asset_in: Asset, asset_out: Asset, amount_in: int)
    def rebalance_pool(self, pool_id: str)
    def update_volatility_metrics(self)
3. Liquidity Management Algorithms
Dynamic Concentration Algorithm:
concentration_factor = base_concentration * (1 + volatility_adjustment)
volatility_adjustment = ln(realized_volatility / baseline_volatility) * sensitivity_parameter
Volume-Weighted Rebalancing:
optimal_range = current_price Â± (volatility_band * volume_weight_factor)
rebalancing_frequency = max(min_frequency, volume_threshold / current_volume)
